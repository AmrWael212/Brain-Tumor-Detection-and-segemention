# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation

This project focuses on detecting and segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning.  
It leverages **TensorFlow/Keras** models (EfficientNetB0), integrates with **Flask** for backend API serving, and provides an interactive interface via **Streamlit**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Pretrained **EfficientNetB0** for tumor detection.
- MRI image **segmentation** for precise tumor localization.
- **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.
- **Flask API** for model deployment and integration with other services.
- Supports **image preprocessing** with OpenCV and PIL.
